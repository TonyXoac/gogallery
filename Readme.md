# GoGallery
***Its like Hugo but for large photo galleries***

GoGallery is a static site generator designed just for large photo sets. 
The problem is that just my modest approximate 1000 image gallery is around 5GB in size. This means traditional static stie generators where you host everything is github is not going to work. Also I do not want to keep reorgaising my photos or rely on some database. I have my photo in folders (albums) and I needed a tool to generate a webpage for those images.

Incomes GoGallery just point it at your photos and it will generate a static site for theme. You can customize the templates to your hearts content. The template language is Handlebars no fancy Javascript single page webapps here. What is included. is image optomization into multiple sizes for the web and the site also generates a PWA so it can act like a desktop/mobile app. Chrome Lighthouse scores the site at 93/100 for performance and 95/100 for accessibility

The Software also has a dashboard that you can use to manage the photos e.g change captions add albums to be hidden etc. You can also preview the site using the serve command

## History

 The inspiration for this gallery is to provide a some of the functionaities of my old gallery cms Koken which has had no updates in over a year+ and had gone silent. *NOTE* that this is not a replacement for Koken just the very limited features I was using. 

The application uses react frontend and a seperate react dashboard that supports upload and managing photos in collections.

## Installation
Makefile to the rescue

### build all
```
    make
```

### build dashboard
```
    make build-dashboard
```
### build server
```
    make build-server
```


## Usage

Edit the config and change the name basepath and base folder that is used for scanning images

#### Dashboard login
Gogallery on first run will autocreate a admin accound with username `admin` and a 8 character autogenerated password which you will find in the log. Once loged in you can go to settings and user to set it

Dashboard url `%GALLERY_PATH/dashboard`

If you forget the admin password for any reason you can use the `gogallery --reset-admin` which will recrate the admin username and password


## Themes

Version 3.0 has support for users themes. The theme engine chosen is a version of handlebars  using the  https://github.com/mailgun/raymond rendering engine. It mainly inspired by themes written for the very popular blogging engine Ghost.io
 
All Themes will need to have the following pages in order for the site to work:
 - 404.hbs  
 - albums.hbs 
 - collections.hbs    
 - main.hbs 
 - photo.hbs

Optionally you can have a  *"default.hbs"* to define common heading and footers 
The engine has support for partials that can be stored in the subfolder partials and all other assests can be stored the assets folder. 

See the example theme **eastnor** for reference

### Caching 

The server implements its own caching layer after the page has been visited it will cache the page in memory so next load of that page becomes very quick this can produce 10X improvement of load times. 

The Cache gets invalidated if the server restarts or if you have made a change in the dashboard. 


## Caption Generation (Experimental)

There is support for automaitic caption generation of photos. To keep everything local we are using the Image Caption Generator from IBM https://github.com/IBM/MAX-Image-Caption-Generator From experiments this produces terrible captions and its being left in as a POC 

To enable it simply run the docker container and add set the GLLRY_SERVER_CAPTIONURL to the above container IP it will be in form http://172.17.0.2:5000/model/predict"

Now in the Dashboard when you edit the detail of a picture you will see a dropdown of some examples of what the caption generator through of the image. You can chose one or write your own.
